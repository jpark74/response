				<p class="handmadep">"I evoke the term 'handmade web' to refer to web pages coded by hand rather than by software; web pages made and maintained by individuals rather than by businesses or corporations; web pages which are provisional, temporary, or one-of-a-kind; web pages which challenge conventions of reading, writing, design, ownership, privacy, security, or identity."

				<p class="humanityp">“You have to have a sense of humor to live with the web,” says Lucas, “It’s important to keep things light and casual and to remember, at the end of the day, this is just a piece of metal and plastic sitting on your lap.”

				<p class="crystal-gobletp">"Imagine that you have before you a flagon of wine. You may choose your own favourite vintage for this imaginary demonstration, so that it be a deep shimmering crimson in colour. You have two goblets before you. One is of solid gold, wrought in the most Pour and drink; and according to your choice of goblet, I shall know whether or not you are a connoisseur of wine."
